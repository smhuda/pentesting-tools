Please note that I am not the sole owner of this script and have compiled it from bits and peices of shell programming collected from github and stackoverflow.

I've just uploaded a version of running whois command on a list of domains together to avoid repetition of the task and automate it.
The whois in the source code can be replaced by the dig command to use it as a bulk dig script. 

The output is generated in a seperate text file called results.txt.
The input of domains should be listed in the pre-defined text file called domains.txt
